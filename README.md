### Tools

The best tools are the ones fit to your needs and mine vary greatly:

- Full-stack Web dev mostly in the JS ecosystem
- Sysadmin / Ops / SRE type things are done in anything from shell scripts to Ansible to Terraform
- Embedded development in C and CPP; microcontroller stuff mostly in Arduino
- For retrocomputing, I'm happiest in a hex editor / disassembler / decompiler
- OpenSCAD for anything functionally 3D
